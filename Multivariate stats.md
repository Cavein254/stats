# Multiple Linear Regression
The main difference between MLR and SLR is in the number of predictors. In the case of SLR, the equation is in the form
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x $$


MLR differs as it uses multiple predictors in it's equation.
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 + \dots + b_px_p$$
The best way to view the data is by use of a $\bf {scatter}$ $\bf{ plot}$ $\bf{matrix}$ that shows the relationship between the predictors.
It is important to note that the term linear in MLR refers to the $b$ i.e the equation is linear in the $b$-parameter.
It is also possible to encounter models with $\bf{interactions}$. Interactions in a model simply means that the effects of one variable on the response variable when it interacts with another.
### Example
Consider a case where a researcher wants to study factors affecting the performance of a student in school. The researcher may be intrested in determing how
