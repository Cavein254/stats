# Multiple Linear Regression
The main difference between MLR and SLR is in the number of predictors. In the case of SLR, the equation is in the form
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x $$


MLR differs as it uses multiple predictors in it's equation.
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 + \dots + b_px_p$$
The best way to view the data is by use of a $\bf {scatter plotmatrix}$ that shows the relationship between the predictors.
It is important to note that the term linear in MLR does not imply that the graph drawn of the model would be stra
