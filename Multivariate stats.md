# Multiple Linear Regression
The main difference between MLR and SLR is in the number of predictors. In the case of SLR, the equation is in the form
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x $$


MLR differs as it uses multiple predictors to determine the value of $y$.
The best way to view the data is by use of a $\bf {scatter plot matrix}$ that shows the relationship between the predictors.
