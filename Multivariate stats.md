# Multiple Linear Regression
The main difference between MLR and SLR is in the number of predictors. SLR has one predictor while MLR uses several predictors.
$
Here, we use several predictors to determine the model. The best way to view the data is by use of a $\bf {scatter plot matrix}$ that shows the relationship between the predictors.
