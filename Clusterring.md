# Simple Introduction To Clustering
Cluster analysis is an $\bf {explanatory data analysis technique}$ used in various academic fields mostly dealing in large data sets to bring out meaning to the data. The process involves dividing the data into groups which have similar properties that were previously not known.
It is important to note that cluster analysis is not a complete method on its own and should not be used as means to an end rather other statistical procedures should be used together with it. The method suffers a major flow as it cannot diffrentiate between dependent and independent variables.

Example of Application of Clustering
-------------------------------------
$\bf{Marketing}$ - The sole purpose of most businesses is to generate profit. This is only achievable if the cost of goods sold exceed expenses. Marketing plays an important role in driving sales. Therefore, the ability of business to effectively market their products will save the business unnessesary expenses.Clustering can enable business group customers and target them based on their needs.

$\bf{Medicine}$- The process of testing the effectiveness of a drug can be a combersome task. The reason for this is that the responsiveness to treatment between patients greatly varies depending on age, weight, nuitrition, and sex among other factors. Cluster analysis can help group patients depending on their response to treatment.

$\bf{Indexing Web Pages}$ - Search engines use clusterling to group web pages depending on the context. These web pages are then indexed for quick retrival by users. This not only save considerable time but also computing resources.

Finally, social media sites, online retail stores and government agencies can use a person's online data to cluster them hence easily determine their likes, preferences and other data.

## Types of Clustering

There are various types of Clustering. Here, we divide them into two:
